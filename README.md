## Outerbase DUE

This is a project meant to be used as a reference when working with Outerbase.
It depicts a solid system for creating, using, and referencing commands within a
project. The full explanation of things going on here will be linked later in an
article.

## Why the name

`DUE` in `Outerbase DUE` stands for `Define, Use, Export`. This system is named
so because of the way it encourages users to build apps using Outerbase. Where
things are first defined in the codebase, used as a part of the project, and
then exported to be used directly on the Outerbase platform.
